CSS selectors allow you to select the HTML element you want to style. Each type of selector targets a different identifier on your HTML element. For this lab you must use at least one of every bulleted selector method.

Class Selector (.class)
ID Selector (#id)
Universal Selector (*)
Element Selector (element) 
Attribute Selector (e.g. [attribute=foo])     
Pseudo-class Selector (e.g. p::hover)
Selector List (element, element)                   /* select multiple elements */
Combinators (you must use one of each)    /* specify selections based on element positioning in the DOM tree */
Descendant Combinator (element element)
Child Combinator (element > element)
General sibling combinator (element ~ element)
Adjacent sibling combinator (element + element)
Combining Two Selectors (element.class)
