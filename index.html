                        I'm glad I woke up early today to slowly change my sleeping schedule. It's been a tough couple
                        of months just staying in my room all day with little social interaction with people.

                        I do have an interview <b>tomorrow</b> and I'm extremely anxious as I am ill prepared for the interview. I hope
                        that I can get most of my work done today so that I have some time to practice for the interview.

                    Me and my friends went mountain biking, and we were doing a trail that we have done before. Since we were familiar with it, we went pretty loose at a good speed. We hear my friend scream, and we I turn the corner I see that there is a rattlesnack on the trail. My one friend had already ran over it, but me and another friend still needed to pass the snake. We threw rocks and branches at the snake, and this was the rock that finally hit the snake. After the video, the snake got off the trail and we were able to ride past it.

                        I'm glad I woke up early again today, my sleep schedule has been getting much better. I've been waking up pretty late and not being able to fall asleep at night, which I found was a major issue. Thus, to try and resolve it, I would start waking up early no matter how late I slept so that the next night I would be tired enough to fall asleep quickly.

                    <hr>

                    <p> The absolute worst part about today was that while I was preparing for my interview at around 2pm, I get a phone 
                        call from New York. I pick it up and I hear a mechanical keyboard being clicked and then someone asks, "Is this Simon?" I anser yes, thinking <i>this must be a scam phone call</i>. However, I hear something about an interview. In the span of milliseconds everything clicks together. New York is <em>eastern time</em>, it's currently 2pm, and my scheduled time was 5pm. I suddenly realize that this is my interviewer and I apologize repeatedly. In the end, he said it's fine and we can reschedule for next week. Although it was a relief for me, what a <b>horrible</b> first impression on my part. I learned my lesson: <strong>always pay attention to the time zone for appointments in the professional world</strong>.

                        I woke up pretty late today, so not too happy about that. I want to stay efficient everyday but I slept late last night so I was tired. I got some of my work done today, and once I finished my CSE 101 quiz, my parents asked me to help them plan our trip to Illinois for my brother's graduation. I thought to myself <i>Oh this is going to be exciting!</i> I had to order plane tickets, rent a vehicle, and book a hotel room, which I happily did because I like to do that kind of stuff. However, the thing that wasn't too great was the prices of everything. I thought it would be cheap because of COVID, but that was <em>not</em> the case. I spent a lot of money ordering those things for the trip, but did it in a fashionable way by renting the <b>Cadillac Escalade</b> for a couple days. However, the lesson I learned is that <strong>you gotta be a baller to be spending the big dollars</strong>.
